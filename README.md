## High quality SNP, Indel and SSR Resources for <i>Quercus petraea</i> & <i>Q. robur</i>

This page compiles information from a database of high-quality polymorphic loci (SNP, Indel, SSR) characterized across ~530 kb of sequence fragments from genic regions in two Quercus species. These data are published in: <br/>

The data published in this paper correct and largely expand :
* the previous oak candidate genes database of the Quercus Portal at https://arachne.pierroton.inra.fr/QuercusPortal/
* the previous SNP dataset currently available at the eLab from Evoltree www.evoltree.eu/index.php/snp-db/ which are directly derived from these candidate genes. This previous set of SNP can be examined online using the "Fagaceae" & "Quercus petraea/robur" filter options and then "update", and they can also be downloaded in batch from http://www.evoltree.eu/et_extensions/elab-data/SNP_Database_Export.xls

Polymorphic loci lists and additional information are available as Supplementary information of the above reference at the following BioRxiv link:

These include:
* Fragment lists with links to previous assembly ID, Functional annotation, published genetic maps, and Quercus robur unigene
* Exhaustive variant list with summary statistics in both <i>Q. petraea</i> and <i>Q. robur</i> (as identified when excluding the 2 most introgressed individuals of the discovery panel)
* On this repositary, you can also find the same list when excluding the 4 most introgressed individuals (...to be added soon)
